== Installation ==

1. Upload the `mbr-wp-performance` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

3. Access settings via 'WP Performance' in the WordPress admin toolbar
4. Configure features one tab at a time

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin break my site? =

The plugin is designed to be safe, but we recommend:
1. Taking a full backup before using
2. Testing features on a staging site first
3. Enabling features one at a time
4. Testing thoroughly after each change

= Can I use this with a caching plugin? =

Yes! This plugin works alongside caching plugins and provides complementary optimizations.

= Does this work with page builders? =

Yes, the plugin is fully compatible with Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, Oxygen, Bricks, and WPBakery. Optimizations are automatically disabled in editor/preview modes.

= How do I access the settings? =

Click 'WP Performance' in the WordPress admin toolbar at the top of the screen. You can also access individual tabs from the dropdown menu.

= What's the difference between Lazy Loading and Preloading? =

Lazy Loading delays loading of images/videos until they're needed (saving bandwidth), while Preloading loads critical resources early (improving perceived speed). They work together for optimal performance.
